        <!-- Intro -->
        <div class="card">
            <span class="emoji-icon">🤔</span>
            <h2>What was it?</h2>
            <p>Imagine if you went to the store to buy Cheetos, but the cashier said, "Sorry, we can't accept this dollar bill unless the government has a tiny piece of yellow metal in a basement to match it."</p>
            <p>That was the <strong>Gold Standard</strong>. For a long time (until the 1930s and fully ending in 1971), paper money was just a "claim check" for actual gold. </p>
            <p><strong>The Logic:</strong> "Paper is flimsy! Gold is shiny and heavy! Therefore, gold is money!"</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Reason 1 -->
        <div class="card">
            <span class="emoji-icon">⛏️</span>
            <h2>Problem #1: The "Dig a Hole" Economy</h2>
            <p>Imagine the economy is crashing. People are losing jobs. Businesses are closing. The government wants to help by putting more money into the system to get things moving.</p>
            <p><strong>Under the Gold Standard:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Government:</strong> "We need to print more money to help people!"</li>
                <li><strong>Gold Standard:</strong> "Do you have more gold?"</li>
                <li><strong>Government:</strong> "No."</li>
                <li><strong>Gold Standard:</strong> "Then grab a shovel and go find some, loser. Or everyone stays poor."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Basically, the economy couldn't grow unless some guy in California got lucky and found a nugget in a river. <span class="highlight">It's like saying you can't level up in a video game until you find a specific rock in your backyard.</span></p>
        </div>

        <!-- Reason 2 -->
        <div class="card">
            <span class="emoji-icon">📉</span>
            <h2>Problem #2: Deflation (The "Don't Buy Anything" Trap)</h2>
            <p>When money is tied to gold, there is a limited amount of money. If the population grows but the pile of gold stays the same, there isn't enough cash for everyone.</p>
            <p>This causes <strong>Deflation</strong>. This sounds good (stuff gets cheaper!), but it's actually terrible:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If you know a PS5 will cost $500 today, but only $400 next week (because money is getting rarer), you won't buy it today.</li>
                <li>If nobody buys anything today, Sony fires their workers.</li>
                <li>Now nobody has jobs to buy the PS5 next week.</li>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> The Great Depression gets Greater.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Simulation: The Bank Run</h2>
            <p>In the old days, if people got scared, they ran to the bank to trade their paper for gold. But banks didn't keep <em>all</em> the gold in the lobby.</p>

            <h2>The Verdict</h2>
            <p>The Gold Standard was like riding a bicycle with square wheels. Sure, it's sturdy and the wheels won't pop, but it's a really bumpy ride and you can't go very fast.</p>
            <p>We switched to <strong>Fiat Money</strong> (money that has value because the government says so) so we can control the economy better. Now, we only worry about inflation, debt, and crypto bros... but at least we don't have to carry heavy rocks around!</p>
