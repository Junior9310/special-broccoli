    <h2>What Is the Federal Reserve?</h2>
    <p>
      The Federal Reserve, or “the Fed,” is the central bank of the United States. 
      It helps keep the country’s money system safe and steady. The Fed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sets interest rates (which affect loans and savings)</li>
      <li>Tries to keep prices from rising too fast (inflation)</li>
      <li>Supports a strong job market</li>
      <li>Helps keep banks and the financial system stable</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What Does “Independent” Mean?</h2>
    <p>
      When we say the Fed should be independent, we mean that the President and Congress 
      should not control its everyday decisions.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>In simple terms:</strong> The government sets the Fed’s goals, but the Fed decides 
      how to reach those goals.
    </div>
    <p>
      The Fed still has to explain its choices to Congress and the public, so it is independent 
      but not unaccountable.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Independence Matters</h2>

    <h3>1. It Protects the Economy From Short-Term Politics</h3>
    <p>
      Politicians often want quick results, especially before elections. They might want very low 
      interest rates to make the economy look strong right away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sometimes the economy needs tougher choices, like raising interest rates to control inflation. 
      An independent Fed can make these decisions without worrying about elections.
    </p>

    <h3>2. It Helps Keep Inflation Under Control</h3>
    <p>
      If the government could easily push the Fed to create more money, prices could rise too fast. 
      This makes everyday things like food and gas more expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Independent central banks around the world usually have lower, more stable inflation.
    </p>

    <h3>3. It Builds Trust in the Dollar</h3>
    <p>
      People need to trust that their money will hold its value. Businesses need this too.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Fed is independent, people feel more confident that the dollar will stay stable.
    </p>

    <h3>4. It Lets Experts Make Decisions</h3>
    <p>
      The Fed is run by people who study the economy and use data to make choices. Independence 
      helps them focus on facts instead of politics.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>What If the Fed Was Not Independent?</h2>
    <p>Problems could include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Higher inflation</strong> from printing too much money</li>
      <li><strong>Economic ups and downs</strong> caused by short-term political decisions</li>
      <li><strong>Less trust</strong> in the dollar</li>
      <li><strong>Higher borrowing costs</strong> because lenders worry about inflation</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>In One Sentence</h2>
    <p class="highlight">
      The Fed needs independence so it can protect the value of our money and keep the economy stable 
      without political pressure.
